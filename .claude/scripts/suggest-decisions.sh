PROMPT="You are reviewing a Claude Code session for the Goldfish project to identify decisions worth logging.

CURRENT DECISIONS LOG (docs/decisions.md):
${EXISTING}

ALREADY PENDING SUGGESTIONS (docs/decisions_pending.md — do not re-suggest anything already here):
${PENDING}

CONVERSATION:
${CONV}

Identify decisions made in this conversation that are NOT already in either file above.

Worth logging: non-obvious architecture choices, product direction, technology selection, file layout, deferred work with a named trigger, rejected alternatives with lasting implications.
Not worth logging: routine bug fixes, implementation details, obvious choices, UI tweaks with no long-term impact.

For each new decision, use this exact format:
## ${TODAY} — Short title

**Status:** decided | proposed | superseded
**Context:** …
**Decision:** …
**Consequences:** …
**Alternatives considered:** …

---

If nothing new is worth logging, output exactly: NOTHING_TO_LOG

Output ONLY the formatted entries or NOTHING_TO_LOG — no preamble, no commentary."
